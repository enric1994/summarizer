Some background is needed. All of North Africa was ruled by European powers, mostly by France (and the Vichy regime in particular), with Libya an Italian colony and Egypt technically independent, but in practice ruled by Britain. The British also ruled Palestine (now Israel) directly and Jordan and Iraq indirectly. Syria and Lebanon were under Vichy rule until Commonwealth troops seized them at the same time as suppressing a pro-Axis coup in Iraq in 1941. Finally Ethiopia, since its conquest in 1935â€“36, was also an Italian possession.',
